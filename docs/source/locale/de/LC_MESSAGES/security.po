"When we designed the upribox architecture and features security was the "
"first thing on our minds. We wanted to create a box that protects your "
"privacy while surfing the web and we knew that our ambitions would be in "
"vain if we endangered this valuable asset with the mechanisms that were "
"supposed to guard it. For this reason every new feature has to undergo a "
"strict security evaluation before it is rolled out to you. In this "
"process we test the new feature in its entirety and validate that the "
"other security mechanism are still intact. The following chapter covers "
"these security mechanisms and features and tries to give you additional "
"understanding of our thoughts behind them:"

"The software package unattended-upgrades is responsible for automatically"
" keeping the upribox current with the latest security updates. We "
"configured your upribox in a way that it searches for important updates "
"every day and installs them without the need of any interaction with you."
" In more detail the package will perform the following tasks:"

"If you ordered a fully assembled upribox from our website you will find "
"your passwords for the web interface and the WiFi in the included manual."
" These passwords were generated with a cryptographically secure pseudo-"
"random number generator (CSPRNG) which means that the program that "
"created the passwords used operating system specific randomness sources "
"which leads to high unpredictability. The SSH password of your upribox is"
" configured to be the equal to your webinterface password."

"Upriboxes that you assembled yourself with the provided community image "
"are pre-configured with passwords that can be changed in the web "
"interface. Secure passwords should consist of at least 8 characters "
"containing lower-case, upper-case, numbers and special characters."

"When generating a new profile for OpenVPN we create a new pair of "
"certificate (also known as public key) and private key for this profile. "
"Furthermore, we ensure that every upribox has different SSH and VPN keys "
"by re-generating them automatically upon the first boot on every bought "
"upribox but also on upriboxes that you built with the community image."

msgid "Least Privilege"

#: ../../source/security.rst:71
msgid ""
"The upribox architecture follows the principle of least privilege. This "
"means that every part of the system (such as a process, script or user) "
"is only able to access and modify those parts of the system that are "
"necessary for the completion of its tasks. One example for this "
"implementation is that only the central configuration script *upri-"
"config.py* (see :ref:`django-label`) is able to modify files with root "
"privileges."

"To calculate the necessary data for the statistics the upribox aggregates"
" and anonymizes information by calculating the sum of blocked contents "
"and filtered domains over a specific time. This procedure ensures that "
"nobody can make assumptions about another user's internet behaviour. "
"Furthermore, the calculated information is only stored on the upribox "
"itself and never leaves it."

"A common problem with small devices like the upribox is that the hardware"
" and the operating system do not provide enough entropy for a "
"cryptographically secure generation of random numbers. This is a crucial "
"requirement for a fast and secure calculation of keys. The Raspberry Pi "
"has an included random number generator in its hardware. To feed the "
"Raspberry Pi hardware RNG to the entropy pool at */dev/random* that is "
"used in the upribox' Python scripts the package *rng-tools* is installed."

"To get the latest filter rules your upribox communicates with our backend"
" server which provides a self-signed SSL certificate to ensure the "
"authenticity of the received updates. Your upribox uses certificate "
"pinning to associate the server with the expected certificate and is so "
"able to detect an attempted attack immediately."
