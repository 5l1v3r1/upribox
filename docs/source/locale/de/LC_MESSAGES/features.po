msgid ""
"No one likes annoying online advertisements. But this is just the tip of "
"the iceberg when it comes to negative side effects of your internet "
"browsing. Much more harmful and not directly visible to you websites "
"include tools that gather your personal information and use them across "
"multiple websites: so called trackers."

#: ../../source/features.rst:32
msgid ""
"Trackers collect your private data and create a profile of you. This can "
"include sensitive data like your name, gender, age or sexual orientation."
" Apart from the loss of sensitive information itself this can also be to "
"your disadvantage when websites use this profile to decline or adapt "
"their offer to you based on gathered information that my or may not be "
"appropriate."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:44
msgid ""
"The Ninja Mode can be activated inside the upribox webinterface for "
"specific devices. Those devices benefit from the same ad- and tracker "
"blocking mechanisms as in the Silent mode but additionally the traffic "
"will be anonymized."

#: ../../source/features.rst:47
msgid ""
"The upribox Ninja mode uses the Tor anonymity network to hinder tracking "
"of your internet usage. For example, your internet provider will not be "
"able to see which websites you access. Your requests are tunnelled "
"through multiple Tor relays which may cause reduction of your internet "
"speed and websites being displayed in foreign languages."

"For the best protection of your anonymity we recommend the usage of the "
"Tor Browser (download for `Windows <https://www.torproject.org/download"
"/download-easy.html#windows>`__ or `macOS "
"<https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#mac>`__) or "

"Traffic of devices, which are configured to use *No Mode*, is not "
